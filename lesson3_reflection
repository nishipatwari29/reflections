When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i want to access my file remotely from my pc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
so that evry tym i make a commit locally does not reflect back into github . as it may symbolize a complete chnge to show it publically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

clone is from local to local or from github to local
fork is from github to github
branch is to take a differnt path from master.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored local?
helps in updating the master and merging.
