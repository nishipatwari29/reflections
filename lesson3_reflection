When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i want to access my file remotely from my pc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
so that evry tym i make a commit locally does not reflect back into github . as it may symbolize a complete chnge to show it publically.
